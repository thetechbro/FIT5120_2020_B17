                social status, but it can also put much financial strain on you. The relatively low cost of a single 
                pack of cigarettes or a bottle of alcohol conceals the enormous fortune you are spending on alcohol 
                and cigarette over a given period of time.

                It is well established that alcohol abuse can lead to serious financial problems, but not only because of the actual money spent on alcohol. However, 
                because your inhibitions are lowered when you drink alcohol, you may be more likely to impulsively buy things 
                without thinking through the consequences of those purchases. Hence, it never too late to quit alcohol.

                The decision to quit smoking is the most critical step you can take to save money. 
                It is never too late to quit. By quitting smoking, you can lengthen your life expectancy, 
                save money, decrease your risk of disease, and feel healthier.

                Being ready and wanting to quit is

                to him or herself – a gift of life, health, and self-esteem – by becoming a non-smoker.
